* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    I was struggling with how to resolve the merge conflict and how to merge the branch to master after the conflict file was cleaned. I was also confused that my branch version of awesome file is different from the master version of the awesome file. I thought they should be the same. After the GPS session, I learned that after you clean the merge conflict "head" and "===" from the file, you need to add and commit the changes and push the changes to the master. I also learned the changes I made on the branch will not reflect on the same file on the master until I push the hcnges to the master.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    -The difference between git push orgin master and git pull origin master. 
    -Delete the branch on the Github does not delete the local branch, you need to do both 

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    I asked the guide when should I use fetch and merge.

* What still confuses you about git?
    The concept of upstream

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    This is a repeat GPS session, it was very rewarding experience because the guide is very clear and very helpful. I learned more than my first GPS experience.
